Section 3 - Inventory and Win Condition

Instead of taking inventory:
	Follow the self-inventory rule.

This is the self-inventory rule:
	Say "You are carrying:[line break]";
	If the player is not carrying anything:
		say "[tab]Nothing.[line break]";
	If the player is carrying the bottle:
		say "[tab]bottle of water[line break]";
	If the player is carrying the neutrino generator:
		say "[tab]neutrino generator[line break]";
	If the player is carrying the somethingold:
		say "[tab][somethingold][line break]";
	If the player is carrying the somethingnew:
		say "[tab][somethingnew][line break]";
	If the player is carrying the somethingborrowed:
		say "[tab][somethingborrowed][line break]";
	If the player is carrying the somethingblue:
		say "[tab][somethingblue][line break]";
	If the player has four plotitems:
		End the story saying "[Wingametext]";
	Otherwise:
		say "[paragraph break]You are looking for:[line break]";
		If the player is not carrying the somethingborrowed:
			say "[tab]Artifact not covered by Intergalactic Cultural Antiquities Convention[line break]";
		If the player is not carrying the somethingold:
			say "[tab]Substance predating the Terran system[line break]";
		If the player is not carrying the somethingblue:
			say "[tab]Object radiating in the 600 TeraHertz range[line break]";
		If the player is not carrying the somethingnew:
			say "[tab]Material younger than yourself[line break]";

The examine containers rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Wingametext is some text that varies. Wingametext is usually "*** The End ***".
