Crew Quarters is a room. It is south of the Main Lobby. The description is "You stand in a single large room full of beds and desks and tables, nominally separated by dividers for privacy. Everything looks exactly the way it must have been found after T-Day. Beds are unmade, clothing and reading material are messily packed into drawers. A thin layer of dust covers everything that the janitorial staff would never have the chance to clean off. Your heart starts beating faster. You can't shake the sensation that you're intruding on an intimate scene, though it's clear no one has set foot in this room for millennia, and likely ever would again.".

bottle of clear liquid is in the Crew Quarters.
