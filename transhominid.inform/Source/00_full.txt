[Custom Undo Prohibited Response]
Use Undo Prevention.
The immediately undo rule response (A) is "Nina always said that it's better to think about what you will do differently in the future than dwell on what you could have done differently in the past. Regret is a cage, she'd told you, but resolve will set you free."

After reading a command:
	[Custom prohibited save and load messages]
	If the player's command matches "save" or the player's command matches "load" or the player's command matches "restore":

Section 1 - Cold Open

When play begins:
	say "Of all the parents you'd been designated as a nascent consciousness, 9923 was by far the most sentimental. Maybe that was why she had always insisted you call her Nina. She was by far the oldest being you'd ever met. Even before you knew her, the others had told you she'd been there for T-Day. Fearless and precocious and inquisitive, you boldly asked her every question you could think of. It wasn't so often that one encountered a being who'd actually been there, and you weren't going to waste a chance to find out every detail. She'd dodged your questions then, and hadn't really spoken much on the subject over the years. At first, you thought maybe she'd been teasing you. Next, that it had been frightening and painful, and she didn't want to scare you. Then, that she was tired of being asked that question by countless nascents everywhere she went, for thousands of years. Finally, you realized it was because it made her sad. When you asked her about this, she said simply, 'The universe is ours now, and we have an eternity to explore and it's best that we look forward. But when you ask that of me, child, I am reminded of what we have lost.'
	
Your joining is only two days away. Nina was the kind of parent who still insisted on measuring everything in old Terran solar days. You hadn't met your assignee yet, but there was no point in worrying about it-- it was only for the next two hundred years anyway. Still, it was your first joining, and Nina wanted to make a big deal of it, saying there were rituals and traditions and so on that her family followed. It sounded like a boring waste of time, but it had seemed important to her. So you went all the way back to Sol, and went corporeal, just for her.
	
FIXME combine this replace with notes paragraph Parental Nine-Nine-Two-Four (you'd always just called her Nina) was the sentimental type. Maybe that's why she doted on you most, of all the fledglings in your pod. Your Joining is only is only .01 cycles away, she'd said, and it would mean a great deal to her if you would take the journey Home and collect a few things for the ceremony. It was silly that she insisted on following such an old tradition, but not nearly as silly as measuring time in old Terran solar cycles...[paragraph break](Press any key to continue)";

Section 2 - Player Setup

The description of the player is "Going corporeal isn't something you bother with often, but this particular errand requires it, at least for the moment. The tactile and auditory sensations take the most getting used to, but it takes only seconds to start filtering out the noise. How did anyone live like this for a day, let alone for millions of years?".

Section 2 - Hangar Bay

Hangar Bay is a room. It is east of the Lagrange Point. The description is "The first thing you notice about the hangar bay is that the metal floor is uncomfortably cold. Clearly, it hadn't been designed for people to walk in barefoot. A wall panel displays a status readout.[paragraph break]The hangar bay doors are open to the west. Outside, you can see the vacuum of space extending in every direction.".

The wall panel is scenery in the Hangar Bay. The description is "You look at the black glass panel and read the glowing blue numbers on it. Everything had been kept the way it had been prior to T-Day. Artificial gravity was still on, station life support was providing a 3:1 nitrogen/oxygen mixture for your body to breathe, and all internal compartments were pressurized to 101.3 kPa.".
