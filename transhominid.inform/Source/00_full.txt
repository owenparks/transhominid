When play begins:
	say "Parental Unit 9924 (you'd always just called her Nyna) was the sentimental type. Maybe that's why she doted on you most, of all the fledglings in your pod. 'Your joining is only is only 3 cycles away,' she'd said, and it would mean a great deal to her if you would take the Journey and collect a few things before you came back. It was silly that she insisted on following such an old tradition, but not nearly as silly as measuring time in old Terran solar cycles.";

You call out, the sound echoing up and down the metal structure, sound waves colliding and reflecting off each other, a dissonant symphony.
