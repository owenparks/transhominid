Crew Quarters is a room. It is south of the Main Lobby. The description is "Everything had been kept exactly the way it had been found after T-Day. Beds were unmade, clothing and reading material were barely packed into drawers. A thin layer of dust covered everything that the janitorial staff would never have the chance to clean off. Your heart starts to beat a little fast. You can't shake the sensation that you're intruding, though no one has set foot in this room for countless millenia, and likely ever would again.".
