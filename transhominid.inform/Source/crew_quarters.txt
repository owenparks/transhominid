Crew Quarters is a room. It is south of the Main Lobby. The description is "Everything had been kept exactly the way it had been found after T-Day. Beds were unmade, clothing and reading material were barely packed into drawers. A thin layer of dust covers everything that the janitorial staff would never had the chance to clean off. Your heart starts beating faster. You can't shake the sensation that you're intruding on an intimate scene, though it's clear no one has set foot in this room for millenia, and likely ever would again.".
