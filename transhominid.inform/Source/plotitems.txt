Chapter 4 - Plotitems

You feel like you're intruding on some long gone moment of her life, like you're rifling through a photo album without permission. Had she meant you to find this? Was this part of the reason she'd sent you here? You make up your mind not to ask about it. Maybe it was better this way, to let her have these secrets as a parent than have to face a part of her past in front of a child. It was silly to have only thought of her as s mother, as though she'd never had a life outside of you and the other fledglings.[paragraph break]You feel a ripple travel over your skin from shoulders to fingertips, and look down at your arm to see goosebumps."

The bottle is made from plastic, and the liquid inside was distilled to be pure.
